# Blogchain

An example for a Substrate-Node-Template backed custom blockchain

Compile with:

cargo build --release
Start with:

./target/release/node-template --dev
Then you can either use https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template to start up a frontend to connect to the blockchain, or you can use https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer in Development mode using Local Node

Functionality
There is a custom pallet called blogchain implemented, which features a simplistic blogging service.

In terms of extrinsics (functions you can use to interact with the blockchain), you can do three things:

Create a new blog post (blogchain -> create_blog_post) - enter an arbitrary string between 64 and 4096 bytes as the content of your post
Costs: 10000
Comment on an existing blog post (blogchain -> create_blog_post_comment) - enter a blog post id and an arbitrary string between 64 and 1024 bytes - this comment will be saved in a list on the blog post
Costs: 5000
Tip the blog post author (blogchain -> tip_blog_post) - enter a blog post id and an amount to send
Costs: 500 (+amount you wish to send, obviously)
